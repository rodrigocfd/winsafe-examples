# WinSafe examples

This repo contains several examples of native Win32 applications written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) with [WinSafe](https://github.com/rodrigocfd/winsafe). All examples follow the same program structure, which is the recommended way to build a WinSafe application.

Each directory is a full application, with is own `Cargo.toml`.

## Resources

Each example has a `.res` file with its [application resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_(Windows)) (manifests, icons, dialogs and so on). You can edit the `.res` file with any resource editor, or even generate your own `.res` by compiling a `.rc` script.

The `.res` file is linked into the final `.exe` by the `build.rs`, which is a [Cargo build script](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/build-scripts.html).
